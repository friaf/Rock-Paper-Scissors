### Rock Paper Scissors Game

We all know this game from our childhood, and we loved playing it, this version of the game is for adults as the color scheme and design is aimed for the game to feel and look like a casino game with all those green tables and red and black chips. It’s a fun way to reboot your brain with computer’s 100% random choice, that drives you to play more and give you the feeling of playing with a real person.
